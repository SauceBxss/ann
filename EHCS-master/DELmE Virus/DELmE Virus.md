**Experiment 08 - DELmE’s Batch Virus Generator** 


### Aim:
To generate a virus and exploit vulnerabilities in Windows systems using DELmE’s Batch Virus Generator.

### Tools:
- **DELmE’s Batch Virus Generator**: A tool designed for creating various types of batch viruses that can perform malicious actions on a target computer.

### Theory:
**DELmE’s Batch Virus Generator** is a powerful program that enables users to create custom viruses with multiple functionalities. Some of its capabilities include:

1. **Formatting the C: Drive**: This action deletes all data on the primary hard drive, rendering the system unusable.
   
2. **Deleting All Files**: The generator can create scripts to erase all files on the hard disk, causing data loss.

3. **Disabling Admin Privileges**: This feature can restrict access for administrator accounts, preventing essential system changes.

4. **Cleaning the Registry**: Modifying or deleting registry entries can destabilize the operating system.

5. **Changing Home Page**: The generator can change the default web browser's home page, redirecting users to unwanted sites.

6. **Killing Tasks**: This action can terminate critical system processes or applications.

7. **Disabling Antivirus and Firewall**: The tool can create scripts that turn off security measures, making the system vulnerable to other threats.

### Installation and Execution:
1. Download DELmE’s Batch Virus Generator from GitHub.
2. Double-click the downloaded file to initiate the installation.
3. If a dialog box appears indicating the file is malicious, click "More info" and select "Run anyway."
4. Accept the terms and conditions presented in the dialog box.
5. A new window will open, allowing users to create malicious files in .BAT or .TXT format. For this experiment, select the "SPAM WITH MSGBOX" option.
6. Name the virus and author as desired, then save the file in the chosen format.
7. Distribute the .BAT file to the victim’s computer using social engineering tactics and execute it to observe the effects.

### Outcome:
Upon completion of this experiment, students will:
1. Be able to download and run DELmE’s Batch Virus Generator.
2. Understand the principles behind creating batch viruses and the potential consequences of executing such programs.

### Result & Discussion:
In this experiment, students successfully downloaded and executed DELmE’s Batch Virus Generator, exploring its features and functionalities. They engaged in creating a batch virus, specifically using the "SPAM WITH MSGBOX" option, which generates repetitive message boxes on the target computer.

Through practical engagement, students learned about the ethical implications of virus creation and the potential harm that can be inflicted on victims. They discussed the importance of cybersecurity measures and the need for robust defenses against such attacks. 

While the experiment provided insights into the mechanics of virus generation, it also emphasized the responsibility that comes with understanding and using such tools. Students recognized the fine line between ethical hacking for educational purposes and malicious activity that could lead to legal consequences.

In conclusion, this experiment equipped students with knowledge about virus creation techniques and the significance of maintaining security awareness in an increasingly digital world.
