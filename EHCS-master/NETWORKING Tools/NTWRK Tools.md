**Aim:**  
To utilize networking tools such as Advanced IP Scanner, Nmap, Zenmap, and Nessus Scanner for scanning and enumerating active hosts, open ports, running services, and performing vulnerability assessments.

**Tools:**  
- Advanced IP Scanner  
- Nmap  
- Zenmap  
- Nessus Scanner  


**Theory:**  
Scanning is a crucial technique employed in the field of cybersecurity, particularly for ethical hacking. It involves systematically probing a network to gather information about its structure, devices, and potential vulnerabilities. The primary objectives of scanning are to identify open ports, active hosts, services running on those hosts, and any existing security weaknesses.

1. **Network Scanning:**  
   This process helps identify all devices and services operating on a target network. By employing tools such as Nmap and Advanced IP Scanner, ethical hackers can gather data on the types of devices present, their operating systems, and the software versions running on them. This information is critical for assessing the security posture of a network and determining potential entry points for exploitation. Network scanning can be performed either manually or through automated tools, allowing for comprehensive coverage of a networkâ€™s entire range or targeting specific devices.

2. **Network Mapping:**  
   Scanning is also integral to creating a visual representation of a network's infrastructure. By understanding how devices are interconnected, security professionals can identify key systems and their vulnerabilities. Network mapping aids in planning more sophisticated attacks, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, by pinpointing critical targets and understanding their weaknesses. Moreover, it helps in visualizing the network's layout, making it easier to manage and secure.

3. **Vulnerability Scanning:**  
   This aspect of scanning focuses on identifying security flaws within a network or system. Vulnerability scanning utilizes automated software tools to scan for known vulnerabilities, as well as misconfigurations or weaknesses in the implementation of systems. Tools like Nessus Scanner play a vital role in this process, allowing security analysts to identify risks and prioritize remediation efforts based on the severity of the vulnerabilities found. By understanding and addressing these vulnerabilities, organizations can strengthen their defenses against potential cyber threats.


**Outcome:**  
Students will develop the ability to perform active host enumeration, port scanning, service enumeration, and vulnerability assessments using the specified tools.

**Results & Discussion:**  
Through this experiment, students learned to:
- Perform ping sweeping with Advanced IP Scanner to identify active hosts on a network.
- Conduct port scanning and service enumeration using Nmap and Zenmap to find open ports and running services on target hosts.
- Utilize Nessus Scanner for vulnerability assessments to identify weaknesses in networks and systems, reinforcing the importance of proactive security measures.

By understanding these concepts and tools, students are better prepared to identify and mitigate security risks in real-world applications.
