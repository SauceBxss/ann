 **Experiment 06** with Aim, Tools, Theory, Outcome, and Result & Discussion:


### Aim:
To utilize anonymity tools like **Hide.me, AnonymoX, Tmac, and Tails OS** to enhance privacy, maintain anonymity, protect against ISP throttling, secure public Wi-Fi, and safeguard personal data.

### Tools:
- **Hide.me**: A VPN service that provides secure and private internet browsing.
- **AnonymoX**: A browser extension that allows users to change their IP address for anonymity.
- **Tmac**: A tool for changing the Media Access Control (MAC) address of a network adapter.
- **Tails OS**: A privacy-focused operating system designed for anonymity and security.

### Theory:
Maintaining anonymity online is critical, especially when engaging in activities that may expose oneâ€™s identity, such as accessing restricted websites or utilizing torrents. To protect their identity, users often employ proxies, which help obscure their IP addresses.

1. **Types of Proxies**:
   - **Web Proxy**: Provides a straightforward method to change an IP address while browsing without installing additional software. Examples include Hide.me and proxysite.com.
   - **IP Proxy**: Extends proxy capabilities to the entire browser through add-ons like AnonymoX, allowing for more comprehensive anonymity.

2. **MAC Address Spoofing**: This technique involves altering the factory-assigned Media Access Control (MAC) address of a network interface, allowing users to enhance their privacy and bypass network restrictions.

3. **Tails OS**: Tails is a security-focused Linux distribution that emphasizes anonymity. It can be run from a live USB or DVD, ensuring no digital footprint is left behind unless explicitly chosen. Tails routes internet traffic exclusively through the Tor network, enhancing user privacy.

4. **Tor**: The Tor network provides anonymous communication by routing users' internet traffic through volunteer-operated servers, encrypting data and making it difficult to trace the original source or destination.

### Outcome:
By completing this experiment, students will:
1. Understand how to use web proxies and IP proxies to maintain online anonymity.
2. Be able to install and use the Tor browser for secure browsing.
3. Learn how to change the MAC address on both Windows and Linux systems.
4. Gain familiarity with Tails OS and its applications for enhanced privacy.

### Result & Discussion:
Through this experiment, students successfully employed various anonymity tools, starting with Hide.me and AnonymoX to change their IP addresses, thereby allowing access to geo-restricted content and enhancing their online privacy. They learned the steps involved in using these tools effectively.

Next, students utilized TMAC to change their MAC addresses on Windows, exploring how this can help protect their identity on public networks. Similarly, they engaged with Macchanger on Kali Linux, further understanding the implications of MAC address spoofing in maintaining anonymity.

The installation of the Tor browser highlighted the importance of routing internet traffic through a secure and anonymous network, while the Tails OS installation provided hands-on experience with a privacy-focused operating system designed for secure computing.

Overall, this experiment deepened students' understanding of online anonymity and the critical tools available for enhancing privacy and security in an increasingly connected world. It emphasized the need for careful consideration of personal data protection, particularly when using public Wi-Fi or accessing restricted content.
