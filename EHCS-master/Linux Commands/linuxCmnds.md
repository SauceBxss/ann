# Experiment on Kali Linux Basic Commands

## Aim
The aim of this experiment is to explore and understand basic commands in Kali Linux, a Debian-derived Linux distribution used for advanced penetration testing and security research. These commands are foundational to system navigation, file management, and system information retrieval in a Linux environment.

## Tools
- **Kali Linux Operating System**: A Linux distribution specifically tailored for security professionals.
- **Terminal (Command Line Interface)**: The primary tool for executing commands in Kali Linux.

## Theory
Kali Linux is widely used in cybersecurity for tasks such as penetration testing, ethical hacking, and network security assessments. Familiarity with basic Linux commands is essential for system navigation, managing files, and retrieving system information. Each of these commands serves a unique function in interacting with the operating system.

### Commands Overview:
- **Date Command**: Displays the current system date and time.
- **Cal Command**: Shows the calendar of the current month.
- **Cd Command**: Changes the current directory.
- **Cp Command**: Copies files or directories.
- **Whoami Command**: Displays the username of the current user.
- **Ls Command**: Lists files and directories.
- **Cat Command**: Concatenates and displays the content of files.
- **Mkdir Command**: Creates directories.
- **Rm Command**: Removes files or directories.
- **Mv Command**: Moves or renames files and directories.
- **Uname Command**: Prints system information like the operating system name.
- **Uptime Command**: Shows how long the system has been running.
- **Users Command**: Displays the list of users currently logged in.
- **Less Command**: Views the content of a file one screen at a time.
- **More Command**: Similar to `less`, but offers more basic viewing options.
- **Vi Command**: Opens the vi text editor for file editing.
- **Free Command**: Displays the amount of free and used memory.
- **Sort Command**: Sorts lines of text files.
- **History Command**: Shows the command history.
- **Pwd Command**: Displays the current working directory.

## Output

## Results and Discussion
All commands executed successfully in the Kali Linux terminal, allowing for effective system navigation, file management, and information retrieval. This experiment highlights the importance of basic Linux commands, which are essential for users in security fields like penetration testing.

Commands such as `ls`, `cat`, and `pwd` facilitate navigation, while `rm`, `cp`, and `mv` aid in file management. System monitoring is streamlined through commands like `uptime`, `uname`, and `users`.

Overall, this experiment serves as a foundational step in mastering Linux command-line operations, equipping users with essential skills for more advanced tasks in Kali Linux.
