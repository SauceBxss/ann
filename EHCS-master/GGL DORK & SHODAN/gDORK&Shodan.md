# Experiment 02 - Google Dorks

## Aim
The aim of this experiment is to explore and understand Google Dorks, a search technique that uses advanced operators to find information not typically indexed by search engines.

## Tools
- Google

## Theory
Google dorking, also known as Google hacking, is a search-hacking technique that uses advanced search queries to uncover hidden information in Google. Google dorks refer to specific search commands that, when entered into the search bar, reveal parts of websites that are not visible to normal users. This technique is used to find sensitive information about websites and their owners, and can be employed for ethical hacking, SEO strategies, and security assessments.

## Outcomes
Students will:
- Understand the concept of Google Dorks.
- Learn how to perform advanced searches using Google Dorking techniques.

## Results and Discussion
This experiment demonstrated the effectiveness of Google Dorks in uncovering hidden information on the web. By applying various advanced search operators, students successfully identified sensitive data, open ports, and vulnerabilities. The practical application of these techniques provided insight into how both malicious actors and security professionals utilize Google Dorking for information gathering.

The use of Google Dorks is legal, but caution is advised, as it can lead to illegal activities if used to access unauthorized information. Overall, this experiment emphasizes the importance of understanding search techniques in cybersecurity, highlighting their role in both offensive and defensive strategies.

# Experiment on Shodan

## Aim
The aim of this experiment is to explore and understand Shodan, a search engine for internet-connected devices and services, and how it can be utilized for security assessments.

## Tools
- Shodan

## Theory
Shodan is a specialized search engine that identifies devices and services connected to the internet. It provides information about various devices, including servers, routers, webcams, and industrial control systems. Shodan allows users to find specific devices based on search criteria such as location, device type, and known vulnerabilities. It is often referred to as the "search engine for hackers" due to its ability to uncover misconfigured or vulnerable devices.

## Outcomes
Students will:
- Understand the concept of Shodan and its functionality.
- Learn how to perform searches using Shodan to find devices, vulnerabilities, and other information.

## Results and Discussion
This experiment demonstrated the utility of Shodan in discovering vulnerable devices and services on the internet. By applying various search queries, students successfully identified open ports and potential security risks associated with different devices.

The ability to filter results based on location and device type allowed for a deeper understanding of the landscape of internet-connected devices. Shodan serves as a valuable tool for both ethical hacking and security assessments, highlighting the need for organizations to secure their devices against potential threats.

Overall, the experiment underscored the importance of using Shodan as part of a comprehensive security strategy, providing insights into vulnerabilities that can be exploited if not properly managed.
